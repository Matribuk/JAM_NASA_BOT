# JAM_NASA_BOT

This project aims to create a tool for fetching images from NASA's API and embedding them onto a template image along with relevant text. It consists of two main scripts, `paste-image-to-template` and `api`, each serving distinct functionalities.

## Features

- Fetches data from NASA API including image URL, title, description, and copyright information.
- Downloads the image from the provided URL.
- Embeds the fetched image onto a template image.
- Adds text overlay containing title, description, and copyright information to the final image.
- Saves the processed image as a JPEG file.

## Usage

### `paste-image-to-template`

This script fetches data from NASA's API, downloads the image, pastes it onto a template image, adds relevant text, and saves the final image.

### `api`

This script fetches data from NASA's API using environment variables for authentication and date specification. It retrieves the title, image URL, and description of the NASA image of the day and saves them into separate files.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3
- Pillow library (for image processing)
- Requests library (for making HTTP requests)
- Python-dotenv library (for loading environment variables)

## Setup

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Configure environment variables:
   - `API_KEY`: NASA API key
   - `DATE`: Date for fetching NASA image of the day
   - `API_URL`: NASA API endpoint URL

## Usage

1. Execute `paste-image-to-template.py` to process and embed NASA images onto a template.
2. Execute `api.py` to fetch data from NASA's API and store it locally.
